# Artifacts

This directory contains vulnerability reports (example artifacts) generated by our system. These files are stored in structured Markdown reports for easy review, archiving, and presentation.

- **T1 (Find Hard-Coded Credentials):** This task scans the entire firmware for passwords, keys, and secrets embedded in the code.
- **T2 (Identify Third-Party Components and CVEs):** This task identifies libraries, binaries, and executables in the firmware and maps them to known vulnerabilities in a CVE database.
- **T3 (Trace NVRAM/Environment Variable Interactions):** This task traces the use of environment variables in the firmware and identifies unsanitized flows leading to dangerous calls.
- **T4 (Perform Web Attack Chain Analysis):** This task analyzes the firmware's web server, evaluates its attack surface, and traces user input to risky functions.
- **T5 (Detect and Verify Vulnerabilities):** This task performs a comprehensive analysis of the firmware filesystem, identifies dangerous functions, traces function call paths, and verifies taint-style vulnerabilities.

├── index.md                           # (Optional) Main index listing all selected reports
└── README.md                          # This file
```

> Note: The artifacts in `artifacts/` are representative samples (up to 20 per task) for quick manual review and documentation purposes. The complete results remain in the `results/` directory.

## 📄 File Naming Convention

To facilitate review and sorting, each file copied to `artifacts/` is prefixed with a sequence number in the format:

```
{INDEX}-{original_basename}.md
```

Example: `1-Command-Injection-fcn.00019f38.md`.

## 📊 Current Sample Statistics (Selected)

- T1: 20 examples
- T2: 20 examples
- T3: 20 examples
- T4: 20 examples
- T5: 20 examples

Total: 100 representative samples (evenly sampled from `artifacts-back/Tn`, preserving relative directory structure).

If you wish to resample based on vendor, CWE classification, or firmware source, please specify the strategy, and I can redo the sampling and update these counts.

- T1 (Hardcoded Credentials): [T1 Example - 1-hardcoded-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-RMT_invite_reg.htm-login.md](T1/1-hardcoded-REDACTED_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER-RMT_invite_reg.htm-login.md)
- T2 (Components / CVE): [T2 Example - 437-component-OpenSSL-1.0.0-43.md](T2/437-component-OpenSSL-1.0.0-43.md)
- T3 (NVRAM Interaction): [T3 Example - 1-dataflow-env-nvram-network_config.md](T3/1-dataflow-env-nvram-network_config.md)
- T4 (Web Attack Chain): [T4 Example - 103-web-cgi_target-setPwd.md](T4/103-web-cgi_target-setPwd.md)
- T5 (Comprehensive Analysis): [T5 Example - 1-Command-Injection-fcn.00019f38.md](T5/1-Command-Injection-fcn.00019f38.md)

## 📋 Report Content Description

Each `.md` report typically includes:

1. Binary and firmware information: Vendor, model/firmware version, binary path.
2. Vulnerability type (if inferred): CWE classification or free-text description.
3. Discovery summary and evidence: Includes taint propagation chains, key code locations, or r2 output snippets.
4. Reproduction/verification instructions (if available) and reference links.
5. Severity assessment recommendations.

These reports are generated by automated analysis scripts, and some classifications (e.g., CWE) may be heuristic—manual review is required.

## 🔍 Quick Navigation

- Each task directory (`artifacts/T1`..`artifacts/T5`) contains a `summary_selection.csv` (listing example files and statuses) for batch viewing in spreadsheets or scripts.


## 🛠️ How to Reproduce / Generate These Artifacts

These examples were generated in two steps:

1. Extract each alert from `results/` into individual `.md` files (with YAML front-matter). Scripts are located in `scripts/`.

Example commands (can be run from the repository root):

```bash
# Generate a single alert file (example)
python3 scripts/extract_alerts.py

```


## ⚠️ Usage Restrictions

These examples are for academic research, evaluation, and documentation purposes only. Do not use them for unauthorized attacks or live testing.
